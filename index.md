Earth is experiencing a climate emergency as the climate is currently changing more rapidly than ever. In the scientific world, this has already been established but what about everyone else? The responsibility to communicate the causes, the consequences but also the means to limit global warming to normal people lies with the media. Our goal is to understand how the media has responded to this crisis by investigating the role of media sources when reporting speakers' opinion by analyzing their quotes. We will examine the quantity of quotes reported over time and their proportion compared to other topics to obtain an estimate of the relevance of the topic at hand. Moreover, we identify key characteristics of speakers in a given media source and compare these characteristics between different news sources. Opinions are shaped daily by the media and therefore we believe holding them accountable when it comes to urgent matters like this is essential.

For this study, we're conducting our analysis on the Quotebank dataset from the period of 2018-2020. Quotebank is a dataset of quotations from different newspapers and media sources, attributed to their speakers. This provides us with a rich dataset of quotations with different topics, from which we can filter the ones that talk about the environment, and upon which we can base our data story upon.


## Organization
1. Analysis of the most common profiles of the speakers who talk about the environment.
2. A time analysis of the topics 
3. Climate change representation in comparison with other topics.
4. Representation of topics in different newspapers 

## 1.  Would you talk about the environment?
The subject of the environment is brought to light by the people who talk about it. So if we're asking the question of whether the environment is well represented in the media, it stands to reason to know by whom is it usually represented.

In that sense, it's interesting to see who are the people that talk about the environment in the media and what are the characteristics that bring them together. In other words, what is **the common profile for the people that talk about the environment?**.

 For this, we filtered the quotations that talk about the environment, and we retrieved their corresponding speakers along with their characteristics (or **features**). The initial method was easy enough, just count the features that appear most frequently within the environmental speakers. But that is not a sound idea, since the distribution of the features of the environmental speakers may be polluted by the underlying distribution of these features among all speakers.

For instance, only 1% of the speakers are recorded having an academic degree. So if we count the ones who have spoken about the environment, we are bound to find that most them are uneducated because of the underlying overall distribution of the speakers having an academic degree or not. This can make us draw bad conclusions from this.

We need to come up with a better metric, that measures approximately the **likelihood of speaker talking about the environment based on a certain feature**. For this we can use the **ratio of environmental speakers per feature** or in short **the environmental ratio**. That is for a certain feature f we calculate:

*# environmental speakers with feature f / total # of speakers with feature f*

and we can translate this into the likelihood of speaker speaking about the environment, given he has feature f.

![Environmental Ratios of top occupations vs Top environmental ratios](resources/occupation_top_ratios_vs_ratios_tops.png)

For example, using this ratio we can see that the jobs with the highest environmental ratio tend to be within **Sports** (e.g. football player...) & **Arts**(e.g. musician, actor).

Using this approach we get the following:

[TODO]

 Note that up until now, we **isolated each feature** and then we did analysis on it separately from the other features. But one must remember that a speaker's profile is made up of several features, and sometimes the distribution of one feature may affect the distribution of another. And hence analysis should be made on the profile as a combined set of features, and not as a combination of analysis of each separate feature.

### Research Question 3 - What is the magnitude of the presence of enviromental quotes compared to other significant topics ? A year in review. 

To answer this equation first we had to decide : Which other topics should we use in order to draw a meaningful comparison ? The topics we concluded to were LGBT Rights, Brexit and Gun Control. What lead us to this decision is our belief that during the time that our dataset is covering these topics were similarly occupying the common people and the press. Additionaly, they are all polarizing issues with multiple ethical standpoints but also potential devastating effects on the community. To begin with, we noticed that during 2020 the percentage of quotations related to the environment were less than 0.8% followed closely by LGBT rights while the other 2 topics were even lower. Moving on, we made an analysis as to how these topics are represented in newspapers. For this task we chose newspapers whose followers were considered to be either in liberal or conservative ideological group. Our conclusion was that the more conservative the readers of a certain newspaper were, the more the distribution of the quotes among those four topics was leaning towards the environment. Next, we investigated this magnitude of environmental quotes but from a speaker's point of view. Our inquiry was the following : Given a group of people formed by a common attribute, in relation to the total amount of quotes made by this group of people, what percentage of these quotes was related to the environment ? Based on occupation our results the group of people with the highest numbers were the researchers, followed by the independent politicians and then the Germans.

### Research Question 4 - What are main differences and common patterns between media sources about speaker profiles for environmental quotes?

After having analyzed speakers in general in part 1, a deep time series analysis in part 2 and some topic relevant investigations in part 3, we saw in part 4 what drives the characteristics between speakers that have been quoted about the environment in the top 10 news papers measured by their total count of all environmentally related quoted between 2018 and 2020. While all top 10 news sources had a share that is roughly equal, there were some interesting differences when it comes to the speakers attributes within a specific news source. We found that in particular people have been quoted with high shares by almost all news that belong to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. What was striking was the rather high share of Democratic speakers that have been quoted by the right-winged news source breitbart (something unusual perhaps). Also their occupations differed quite a lot. Politicians, for example, were almost equally present in all news sources, while especially eurekalert, a science-based news journal quoted researchers much more often than any other profession, something we would expect. Finally, we digged deeper for those two rather opposing news sources and tried to find out what features determine the likelihood with which someone is quoted about the environment by breitbart. We found that being in the Democratic Party dramatically increases (by a factor 2) ones chances while also the age plays an important role.

### Conclusion
In this study, we've tried to answer the question about whether the environment has a good representation in the media. It's a hard question to answer so we approached it from different angles: 
- It was interesting to see who's likely to speak about the environment 
- 
-
- 

We've seen that the environment is not equally represented across the media.
